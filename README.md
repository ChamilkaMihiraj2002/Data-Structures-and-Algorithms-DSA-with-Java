# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Java

## Repository Description

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. It serves as a personal learning journey and a resource for others interested in understanding DSA concepts and their Java implementations.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, and Circular Linked List.
- **Stacks**: Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queues**: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, and Deque.
- **Trees**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Heaps.
- **Graphs**: Representations (Adjacency Matrix and List), Traversals (DFS, BFS).
- **Hashing**: Hash Tables and Hash Maps.

### 2. Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search.
- **Recursion**: Factorials, Fibonacci, and other recursive problems.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples like Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Huffman Encoding, Kruskal's, and Prim's.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, etc.
- **Backtracking**: N-Queens, Rat in a Maze.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChamilkaMihiraj2002/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-DSA-with-Java.git
